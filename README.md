# Online Store

## Description

This is a backend server that manages an online store's products, categories, and tags. It provides API routes for retrieving, creating, modifying, and deleting data, enabling seamless integration with a front-end web application. I developed this project to fully understand the key functionalities of a backend web application, which serves as the bridge between the front-end interface and the application's logic and database. Through this project, I gained insights into the roles of various npm libraries: Express.js for handling API routes, Sequelize for managing database models, Dotenv for configuring environment variables, and Pg for database connection and queries. Overall, this project was an invaluable learning experience.
